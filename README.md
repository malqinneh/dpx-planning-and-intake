# DPX Experience Design Workflow

In order to request design input or support on something you're working on, you can either:

1. Create an issue in your own repo and apply the label `xd`
1. Create an issue in this repo using one of the [issue templates](https://github.com/mozilla/dpx-design-process/issues/new/choose)

If you create an issue in your own repo, make sure that it's a repo that the Experience Design team has access to. When in doubt, ping [@phirework](https://github.com/phirework).

Issues from both of these sources will be linked to the Experience Design team's [Zenhub workflow board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/experience-design-workflow-5f58057dfb3d02001259cefb/board?labels=xd), where you can also see what else they're working on.
